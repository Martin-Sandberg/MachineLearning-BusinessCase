# MachineLearning-BusinessCase

Capstone Project of the Machine Learning course in the MSc. in Business Analytics program.

Apprentice Chef is a hypothetical company with a unique spin on cooking at home. Developed for the busy professional that has little to no skills in the kitchen, they offer a wide selection of daily-prepared gourmet meals delivered directly to your door. Executives at Apprentice Chef are interested in predicting:

- How much revenue they could expect from each customer within their first year of using Apprentice Chef services
- Which customers will subscribe to the "Halfway There" service, a cross-selling promotion
